- Auto stats calculation for ranking (later add image processing for completely automatic stats calculation).
- Add moderation levels. 
None (anyone can upate their stats), 
Light (auto moderation by the bot. Checks your stats histroy and sees if there's an unusualy high jump in stats)
Medium (an image is processed and the stats update is sent to a moderation chat where moderators approve the stats update)
Heavy (Only allow manual moderation and stats updates)

- Automatic prefarm stats calculations. Just start a tally and anyone that posts will be tallied up. People that post multiple times will automatically update their previous stats updates.

- Automatic team creation. Grabs everyones ranks, calculates out a rough estimate of how much you can prefarm and output in the time alloted for a contract and then automatically builds perfect teams
