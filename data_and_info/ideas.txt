- Auto stats calculation for ranking (later add image processing for completely automatic stats calculation).
- Add moderation levels. 
0 None (anyone can upate their stats), 
1 Light (auto moderation by the bot. Checks your stats histroy and sees if there's an unusualy high jump in stats)
2 Medium (members with a set trusted role can update their stats, but everyone else needs moderation approval)
3 Heavy (an image is processed and the stats update is sent to a moderation chat where moderators approve the stats update)
4 Restrictive (Only allow manual moderation and stats updates)

- Automatic prefarm stats calculations. Just start a tally and anyone that posts will be tallied up. People that post multiple times will automatically update their previous stats updates.

- Automatic team creation. Grabs everyones ranks, calculates out a rough estimate of how much you can prefarm and output in the time alloted for a contract and then automatically builds perfect teams
